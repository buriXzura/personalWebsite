            <h2>ü§ù Personal Research Journey with Your Group</h2>
            <p>
                During the COVID pandemic, I was eager to get my hands dirty with systems research beyond coursework. I approached you seeking 
                an opportunity to engage in meaningful research work, and you graciously provided me with an excellent opportunity to collaborate 
                with <strong>Dr. Baptiste</strong>, who was working as a post-doc in your group at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. Baptiste introduced me to cutting-edge work on <strong>persistent memory hardware</strong>, and together we embarked on developing 
                a high-performance persistent key-value store. Working with him, I was able to successfully implement <strong>ReMassTree</strong> - 
                a novel B-link tree with hierarchical concurrency control that addressed critical limitations in existing frameworks. 
                We achieved remarkable results: 3.159M operations per second with 99.99% space efficiency, demonstrating superior performance 
                compared to DRAM implementations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The collaboration was so enriching that I asked Dr. Baptiste if I could visit him in person during <strong>winter 2022</strong> 
                in <strong>Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland</strong>. This visit allowed us to work together on <strong>blockchain transaction optimization</strong> 
                through frequency-aware Merkle tree structures. The in-person discussions were invaluable - we analyzed 21 research papers, 
                discovered significant performance benefits (up to 30% improvement), but more importantly, identified fundamental theoretical 
                limitations that prevented these optimizations from being safely deployed in consensus systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                This systems rigor and hands-on research experience under your guidance have prepared me exceptionally well to move forward 
                in my mission to design <strong>cooperative AI systems and governance mechanisms</strong> that ensure AI deployments widen access 
                rather than deepen societal divides. The experience of understanding how local design choices cascade through complex systems - 
                whether in concurrent data structures or blockchain consensus - is directly applicable to my research goals in network-aware AI 
                and mechanism design.

            <h2>üéØ Research Motivation & Academic Goals</h2>
            <p>
                I am applying to top-tier Master's programs in Computer Science with a focus on <strong>Cooperative AI, Multi-Agent Systems, and Mechanism Design</strong>. 
                My passion lies in designing AI deployments that are safe and empowering for everyone - systems that widen access rather than deepen divides.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through industry experience at Uber and independent research projects, I have witnessed how seemingly local design choices 
                can shape incentives and opportunities at massive scale. This has motivated my research focus on:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cooperative AI:</strong> Designing mechanisms that align incentives and induce cooperation among learning agents</li>
                <li><strong>Network Science:</strong> Understanding how algorithmic decisions cascade through social and technical networks</li>
                <li><strong>Mechanism Design:</strong> Creating protocols and governance structures for AI deployments under uncertainty</li>
                <li><strong>Systems Programming:</strong> High-performance data structures, concurrent algorithms, and distributed systems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                My goal is to move from ad hoc fixes to principled mechanisms - developing computational approaches that ensure 
                AI systems avoid low-welfare equilibria and steer toward beneficial outcomes for society.

                        Working closely with Dr. Baptiste, I developed a novel persistent memory B-link tree with hierarchical concurrency control,

                        During my research visit to Neuch√¢tel, Dr. Baptiste and I conducted a comprehensive analysis of frequency-aware blockchain

            <h2>üéØ How This Research Experience Supports My AI Governance Mission</h2>
            <p>The systems research experience gained through your group provides crucial foundations for my mission to design cooperative AI systems that widen access rather than gaps:</p>
            
            <div class="relevance-point">
                <h3>üîó From Local Choices to Global Impact</h3>
                <p>Working with Dr. Baptiste taught me how seemingly local design choices - whether in concurrency control mechanisms or 
                blockchain optimization strategies - cascade through entire systems with far-reaching consequences. This mirrors exactly 
                what I've observed at Uber: algorithmic choices that appear technical become social choices affecting millions of users. 
                Your group's research gave me the systems thinking foundation essential for understanding how AI decisions propagate through 
                social and technical networks.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="relevance-point">
                <h3>üßÆ From Ad Hoc Fixes to Principled Mechanisms</h3>
                <p>The rigorous theoretical approach I learned working with Dr. Baptiste - moving from intuitive optimizations to principled 
                analysis of fundamental constraints - is precisely what I need for AI governance research. The Merkle tree project exemplifies 
                this: we moved beyond "this optimization works" to "here's why this entire class of optimizations is fundamentally incompatible 
                with distributed consensus." This methodology of establishing theoretical boundaries and designing principled mechanisms is central 
                to my goal of creating AI governance protocols that avoid harmful equilibria.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="relevance-point">
                <h3>üßÆ Mathematical Rigor & Computational Implementation</h3>
                <p>Successfully implementing complex concurrent algorithms (ReMassTree) and analyzing theoretical boundaries (Merkle trees) 
                demonstrates my ability to bridge mathematical theory and computational practice - exactly what's needed for 
                computational mechanism design and multi-agent learning systems.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="relevance-point">
                <h3>üåê Multi-Agent Coordination Experience</h3>
                <p>Designing concurrency control mechanisms for database systems is fundamentally about coordinating multiple agents 
                (threads/processes) to avoid conflicts while maximizing performance. This directly translates to designing protocols 
                that coordinate AI agents to avoid harmful equilibria while achieving beneficial outcomes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="relevance-point">
                <h3>üìä Empirical Evaluation & Validation</h3>
                <p>Both projects involved rigorous performance evaluation, benchmarking across different scenarios, and understanding 
                when theoretical guarantees hold in practice. This empirical mindset will be crucial for validating mechanism designs 
                in real social and organizational settings - a key component of my research vision.</p>
